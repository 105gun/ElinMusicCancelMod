[h2] Introduction[/h2]
This mod allows you to [b]click the right mouse button[/b] again in a specific input window (presumably at the end of the first note) to cancel music performance and get an extra bonus for Music. Special rules exist for individual instruments, with different input windows. For example, the wooden gong restores Karma.

[h2] Types of Cancels [/h2]
There are two types of Cancelss, Good Cancel and Perfect Cancel, the latter of which has a stricter input window; Perfect Cancel gives a wider range of gold bonuses and a chance to regain energy.

[h2] Special Rules [/h2]
[h3] Wooden Gong [/h3]
- Atonement - On Perfect Cancel, slightly restores Karma lost in 5 mins (real time).
- Confession - On Perfect Cancel, a low probability of gaining Karma, with the Karma values gained is related to Faith.

[h3] Panty [/h3]
- DokiDoki - On Good Cancel, the listeners around you will start loving each other.
- Dreamlarva - On Perfect Cancel, a low probability of getting a Dreamlarva, with the probability being related to Music. This is possible even if the player is not a succubus.

[h3] Other [/h3]
TODO...
